Distributed Systems Assignment 4

There is error handling at the server and client creation/establishment. Client handling, if the client crashes or otherwise "disappears". There's also error handling at writing and receiving messages. 
I had issues implementing the private messaging, there is implementation for it in the code, but it doesn't work as intended, I tried to focus on the distributed nature of the system and ended up not successfully implementing the private messaging part.
